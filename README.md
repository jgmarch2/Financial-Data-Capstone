# Financial-Data-Capstone

This project focuses on WTI crude oil. Crude oil is the most important commodity in the world and is a barometer for how the economy is doing.

I chose to analyze assets that are typically sensitive to the economic cycle and specifically crude oil.

The symbols are as follows:

XOM - Exxon
LQD - Investment Grade Bonds
HYG - High Yield Bonds
CVX - Chevron
TLT - 20 + year Treasury Bonds

This project finds the performance, expected return, and risk of each asset over the past year. I also find how correlated the assets are with eachother.
Towards the end we find out the optimal portfolio when taking into account all the information above. 

I attached the plots in PDF format and the outputs in the outputs section.
